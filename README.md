# OGameExpoBot
Bot for sending expeditions in OGame. 

## Installation

* Click on **Code** on this page and download the .zip file. Desarchive the files. 
* You may also need to install python3 from www.python.org.
* Open main.py with a text editor (notepad works too) and replace **YOUR EMAIL** and **YOUR PASSWORD** with your login details. 

## HOW TO RUN

The code comes with a virtual environment already setup. 
Navigate to ./SelBots/Scripts and open a command prompt at that location
In the command prompt type the following:
* activate
* cd ../..
* main.py -f expo300LC -e 3

## Tips

The command to execute the bot is **main.py -f <formation-name> -e <number-of-expeditions>** where *<formation-name>* is the formation you want to use (found in formations.py) and *<number-of-expeditions>* is the number of expeditions you want to send.
  
  The bot comes with one formation, but you can add custom ones in the **formations.py** or you can just simply change the amount of ships you want to send.
